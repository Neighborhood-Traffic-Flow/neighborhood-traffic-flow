# Example of Road Type Feature

Users can also view the road types in a neighborhood by selecting `Road Type` as their map type. As with the other features, users can select a neighborhood either from the dropdown or by selecting the neighborhood in the Seattle Neighborhoods map.


### Road Type:
The app shows road types in a selected neighborhood by different colors depending on a road's classifications. Hovering over a given street on the road map displays the street name and road classification for that street.

Using the road type bar chart, users can look at the percentage of roads with a given classification in their selected neighborhood and compare to that of Seattle. Users can hover over the graph to view the the maximum percentage for their chosen neighborhood in comparison to the city of Seattle. Grey boxes represent the road types in Greater Seattle area, 
blue boxes represents the road types in the selected neighborhood.
