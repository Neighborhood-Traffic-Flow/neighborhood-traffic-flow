# Example of Traffic Flow Feature

Neighborhoods can be selected from the dropdown menu, or by clicking a neighborhood directly in the Seattle Neighborhoods map. From there, users can select a map type (either `Traffic Flow`, `Speed Limit`, or `Road Type`) and also view historical data by sliding the input to a different year.

### Traffic flow:
After selecting a specific neighborhood, the app will show the average weekly traffic flow (per 1,000 vehicles) on the neighborhood map by color. A tooltip will also appear when users hover over the road map. Users can view the street names and street's flow counts from the tooltip.

Users can also view historical flow count data about their selected neighborhood. Users can hover over the
flow count box and whisker plot to view the the average statistics over a time series from 2007-2018. Grey boxes represent the overall traffic flow counts in
Greater Seattle area, blue boxes represents the traffic flow counts in selected neighborhood.
