# Example of Speed Limit Feature

Users can also view the speed limit in a neighborhood by selecting `Speed Limit` as their map type. As with the traffic flow feature, users can select a neighborhood either from the dropdown or by selecting the neighborhood in the Seattle Neighborhoods map.

### Speed limit:
After selecting a specific neighborhood, the app will show the speed limit on the neighborhood map by color, with red indicating higher speeds, and green indicating lower speeeds. Hovering over a given street on the road map will indicate the street name and speed limit of that street.

Using the speed limit bar chart, users can compare the percentage of roads with all speed limits in their selected neighborhood to that of Seattle. Users can hover over the graph to view the maximum percentage for a given speed limit in both their selected neighborhood and in the city of Seattle. Grey boxes represent the speed limit in Greater Seattle area, blue boxes represents the speed limit in  the selected neighborhood.
